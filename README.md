Metro App Project - README
Introduction
The Metro App project is a C++ application that simulates a metro rail system. It allows users to explore different metro stations, view the metro map, and find the shortest path or minimum cost of traveling between two stations. The project utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and minimum cost efficiently.

Features
List All Stations: View a list of all the metro stations available in the network.

Show Metro Map: Display the metro map, including the fares and distances between stations.

Get Shortest Distance: Find the shortest distance in kilometers between two specified metro stations.

Get Minimum Cost: Determine the minimum cost in rupees of traveling from one station to another.

Get Shortest Path: Obtain the shortest path between two stations, displaying the intermediate stations.

Get Minimum Cost Path: Get the path with the minimum cost to travel between two stations, showing intermediate stations.

How to Use
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

Compile and Run: Compile the metro_app.cpp file and run the executable to start the Metro App.

Explore Menu: Once the Metro App starts, a menu will be displayed. Follow the instructions to explore different features.

Station Codes: Use station codes (e.g., "KM" for Kalkaji Mandir) instead of full station names when prompted.

Find Information: Use the various options in the menu to view stations, metro map, distances, costs, and shortest paths.

Requirements
C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
Dependencies
The Metro App project does not have any external dependencies.
